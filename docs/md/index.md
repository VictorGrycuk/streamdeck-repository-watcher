This is a plug in for [StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) that will monitor the count of issues or pull request of a given **GitHub** repository. It can be configured to count of either issues or pull requests that meet the filter criteria.

- At the moment the repository watcher can monitor **Issues** and **Pull Requests**
- **Press** the StreamDeck key to update the information
- **Press and hold** the StreamDeck key for over two seconds to open the repository issues/pull requests page
- Can be configured to **automatically** refresh the information
- It can use a **GitHub Personal Access Token** to avoid reaching the limit for unauthenticated calls (or don't if you just want to test the plug in)
- Several filtering configuration

Click next for information on the basic functionality or jump to a specific section with the menu on the left.
